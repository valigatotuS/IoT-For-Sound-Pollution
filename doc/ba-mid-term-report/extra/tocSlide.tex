\begin{frame}{Table of contents}
    % because of the \mode* command at the start of every part, the \section, \subsection, ... commands are not detected by the command \tableofcontents
    % As a consequence, the command \tableofcontents produces an empty TOC
    % Therefor the toc must better be compiled manually, as below:
    
    \begin{enumerate}
        \setlength{\itemsep}{+0.75 cm} % to add some air to the toc
    	\item About this project
    	\item Useful packages
    	\item Useful commands
    	\item Making drawings and plots
    	\item Some things to know about notations
    \end{enumerate}
