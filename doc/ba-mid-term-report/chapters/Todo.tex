    \section{To do}
        When we finished the report we send it to our promoter to ask for feedback. He asked us if the LoPy4 support the I2S communication protocol the microphone uses. At first we thought it did because that is what they advertise on their site but when we looked at the data sheet there was nothing to be found about I2S. This made us question what we should believe. After having looked at the pin out of the LoPy4 we couldn't find a way to work with I2S.
        
        This is a big problem because it means we have to restart a part of the project. We will either need to find a converter from I2S to something the LoPy4 understands or we could also change to an analog mic. Changing to analog means we will have to do further research what extra components analog signals need. Since this will be quiet some work we decided to leave it for the start of the next semester since exams will be starting soon.
        

        To do:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item be sure the LoPy4 doesn't understand I2S
            \item Find I2S converter to something the LoPy4 understands
            \item see what extra components an analog mic needs
            \item find what communication protocol analog mic needs
            \item compare prices and how big the PCB will get
            \item use the facts to decide on what new direction we will go in
        \end{itemize}
